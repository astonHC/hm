# CS2_TP - Rules and Pre-requisites:

# Why have this?

The following readme section is meant to act as the surrogate means of providing clarity into how and when to commit your work to GitHub and how to go about such.

This is further exemplified for those who are new to GitHub and are a little intimidated from the offset

# 1. Basics:

To get started with your developments, it could help if you decide to ``git clone`` the repository

```
git clone (https://github.com/hazzaaclark/DreamTeam.git) -name it whatever you'd like

cd new_repo
```

As of ``09/10/24``, not sufficient changes have been made to the ``main`` branch so you'd effectively be cloning an empty repo

# 2. Your own work:

From what we have all discussed, we have gone about assigning coordinator's for each category of development, (Front and Backend)

As we go about the rest of the developments, your coordinators will continue to point you in the right direction pertaining towards what needs to be done
at a given time 

Furthermore, your coordinators will also be the ones you will go to for verification regarding whether your changes will be sufficient to be subsequently branched into ``main``

Therefore, it goes without saying but, when making your own stuff, **PLEASE** make your own branch
Additionally, name it something relevant as part of your evidence that way, your work is indicative of what it is you have produced


Here is a demonstration of how to make your own branch (this is under the impression that you are using this website to make your new branches)

```
1. Make a new branch by clicking on this menu then "View all branches"
```

```
2. Make a new Branch and name it (make sure it derives from main
```

```
3 Now you have your own place for developments :)
```

# 3. Conclusion:

JUst to round this out, PLEASE make sure that when you do make changes to your branch, granted if you think they are sufficient, make sure you pass these 
through with your area's coordinator

[Backend Coordinator](https://github.com/hazzaaclark)

Feel free to ask in the server if you have any further questions, happy developing and God Bless
